ConcreteDesignPy is a Python library for designing and analyzing reinforced concrete structures, supporting NSCP 2015, ASCE 41, ACI 318-19. The library provides structural engineers with efficient design tools for flexure, shear, axial loads, and moment interaction.

Disclaimer: This library is still under development as an open-source project. Users are responsible for verifying the accuracy and applicability of the results before applying them to real-world engineering problems. The developers do not assume liability for any errors or misuse of the tool.
